Arduino-CMake, as the name suggests, combines the best of both worlds:

1. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
2. [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

It is a simple solution to enable developers develop **Arduino** programs using their favorite IDEs. 

While there's nothing wrong with the **Arduino IDE** that comes along with the **Arduino SDK**, many developers feel like it's missing some valuable features other IDEs do have. 
As it turns out, the **Arduino SDK** also includes the Arduino toolchain - meaning it could be built using a build system that respects that, such as **CMake**.

Why CMake? 
Because it's entirely cross-platform, it's modern, but most importantly - It's extremely extensible yet so easy to learn and use!

If that's your first time here, you probably should head to the **Getting Started** section.
If you want to read further about the API or even the internals of the framework - Documentation is available under the **Usage** and **Developers** sections.
